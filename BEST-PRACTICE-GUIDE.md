Best Practices
==============

Please ensure, that:
 1. you do not have any open handles (DB connections, Files, ...) when:
   1. executing the create method
 1. you are not using objects in the child process, that are going to close shared resources (f.e. in the __destruct method)
 1. your child processes create their own handles (DB connections, Files, ...)

**THE STRAIGHT TIP:** In case you need handles (f.e. DB connections) in your child processes, open them in the onProcessCreate method and close them in the onProcessDestroy method
